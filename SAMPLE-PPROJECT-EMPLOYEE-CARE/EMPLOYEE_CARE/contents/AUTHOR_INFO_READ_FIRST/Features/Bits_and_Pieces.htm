<h1>Bits and Pieces</h1>
<p>There&#39;s always something that doesn&#39;t warrant a full topic or fit neatly 
 somewhere else! Here are some of those.</p>
<h2>Expanding and Dropdown Hotspots with Dynamic HTML (DHTML)</h2>
<p>The idea of &quot;progressive disclosure&quot; is something authors 
 are using in order to layer content especially with smaller screens on 
 mobile devices. In this way, the end-user self-selects the information 
 they are interested in. You can access DHTML on the Insert ribbon.</p>
<h2>Topic Titles can have User Defined Variables assigned</h2>
<p>Control and customize content better by applying a User Defined Variable 
 to a wider range of content, including the Topic Title and Table of Contents. 
 Automate updates by simply making a single change to the UDV value in 
 the UDV pod. To see this in action, go to the <a href="../READ_FIRST.htm">About 
 Employee Care 3</a> topic, right click on the topic and choose &quot;Topic 
 Properties.&quot; You will see that the Knowledge Base Name User Defined 
 Variable has been inserted in to the Topic Title.</p>

<p class="Normal-Single"> </p>
<p>The UDV Properties tell you where the each UDV has been used...</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/udv02.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p class="Normal-Single"> </p>
<p>... and that can include the Table of Contents.</p>

<h2>Control + Click jumps you to your target topic in Design Editor</h2>
<p>Try control + click on <a href="../READ_FIRST.htm">this link</a> to 
 jump to the About Employee Care 3 topic.</p>
<h2>Clear Formatting and Reset Style</h2>
<p>One constant frustration for authors is importing content from documents 
 written without proper styling. When imported into RoboHelp, &quot;inline styles&quot; or &quot;overides&quot; 
 can defeat your hard work in designing a proper CSS. Clear Formatting 
 and Reset Style are commands that let your CSS control the styling without 
 inline styles getting in the way.</p>
<ul class="BulletedAboutTopics">
	<li class="BulletedAboutTopics"><p class="ListSpacing">Make a selection 
	 and click Format &gt; Clear formatting. All styling is cleared.</p></li>
	<li class="BulletedAboutTopics"><p class="ListSpacing">Reset Style 
	 is done from the Styles and Formatting pod. In this scenario, resetting 
	 a style resets both CSS and inline styles from a single HTML element 
	 by removing style related attributes like &quot;class&quot; and &quot;style&quot; 
	 from selected HTML element tag. Other CSS code remains.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Enhanced CSS3 management</h2>
<p>Create CSS styles either using a built-in visual style editor or choose 
 a new HTML code editor for those who like to edit directly. View and modify 
 attributes, edit the &lt;img&gt; tags, and format 
 hyperlinks, text boxes, and block elements.</p>
<h2>Close All But This</h2>
<p>When the help author has elected to use the Allow Editing of Multiple 
 Topics function, they are also able to right-click any tab in the editor 
 and choose to close all other open tabs.</p>
<h2>Remember Project State</h2>
<p>From RoboHelp (2015 release) whichever topics you have open in the Design 
 Editor when you close it will reopen when you return.</p>
<p class="EmphasisSlate">Note: Which topics were open is held in the CPD 
 file so if you delete the CPD, RoboHelp will not reopen the topics.</p>
