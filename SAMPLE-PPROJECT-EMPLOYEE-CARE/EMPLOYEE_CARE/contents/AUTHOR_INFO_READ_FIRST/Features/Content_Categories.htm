<h1>Content Categories</h1>
<p><a href="Dynamic_Content_Filtering.htm">Dynamic Content Filtering</a> 
 is an HTML5 feature for responsive layouts as it relies on code not available 
 in WebHelp. Instead for WebHelp you can use Content Categories (sometimes 
 referred to as Dynamic User-Centric Content) to provide end-users with 
 various options in a dropdown. The content is then filtered according 
 to their choice.</p>
<p>The author can customize the content according to user roles, product 
 types, geographical areas or whatever is preferred.</p>
<p>In this sample project the WebHelp Content Categories output is set 
 up to show how this works. Generate that output and you can see the differences 
 described below.</p>
