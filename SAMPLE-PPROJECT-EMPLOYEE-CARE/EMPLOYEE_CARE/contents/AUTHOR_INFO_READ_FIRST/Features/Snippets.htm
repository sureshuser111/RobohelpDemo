<h1>Snippets</h1>
<h2>Content Reuse for Images, Tables, Text and More</h2>
<p>Snippets are blocks that can contain text, variables, images and suchlike 
 to form a complete paragraph. They are especially useful where you need 
 to repeat the same content in many topics as any change only has to be 
 made once.</p>
<h2>Snippet Management</h2>
<p>The Snippets pod supports creating categories and organizing many different 
 Snippets into different categories. This will help simplify the management 
 of Snippets.</p>
<p>Some Adobe RoboHelp authors have developed quite a number of Snippets. 
 For an Adobe RoboHelp author that has created a large number of snippets, 
 they will find a field at the top of the Snippets pod that allows them 
 to search for Snippets.</p>

<h2>Snippet Conversion</h2>
<p>Occasionally the Adobe RoboHelp author has a need to convert a snippet 
 appearing inside a topic to become part of the actual topic content. This 
 may be where the snippet has to be different in one topic.</p>
<p>Adobe RoboHelp allows the help author to right-click a snippet inside 
 a topic and convert the content from a Snippet to topic content.</p>
