<h1>Sharing Topics and Other Resources</h1>
<p class="EmphasisSlate">Resource Manager allows you to share images, snippets, 
 master pages, topics and multimedia files such as SWF with other authors 
 and other projects, even if they are stored in cloud-based locations such 
 as Dropbox, One Drive and Google Drive.</p>
<p>You can make the Resource Manager pod work in various ways:</p>
<ul class="BulletedAboutTopics">
	<li class="BulletedAboutTopics"><p class="ListSpacing">You can define 
	 a single common location where all resources would be shared.</p></li>
	<li class="BulletedAboutTopics"><p class="ListSpacing">You can define 
	 multiple locations for your resources.</p></li>
	<li class="BulletedAboutTopics"><p class="ListSpacing">You can define 
	 different locations for storing each resource type.</p></li>
	<li class="BulletedAboutTopics"><p>The locations can include the popular 
	 cloud storage services, <span style="font-weight: bold;">SharePoint</span> 
	 sites as well as <span style="font-weight: bold;">network shares</span>. 
	 In the example below, both <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dropbox</span> 
	 and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Google Drive</span> have been 
	 added as Shared Locations.<br/>
	<br/>

</ul>
<p>RoboHelp establishes a link between any resources in the project and 
 the Resource Manager and scans both the Project and Resource Manager locations 
 periodically to see if anything has changed. If an asset is changed in 
 some way, RoboHelp notifies you of the change.</p>
<p>Shown below is the path of a drag of a topic from the Project Manager 
 to the Resource Manager. Note that the color turns green as the link is 
 made. There is also a visual preview of the graphic which happens to be 
 included in the topic.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/TopicSharing-In-Sync.jpg" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p class="Normal-Single"> </p>
<p>When the author makes a change in the topic and saves, the icons and 
 topic title turn red to indicate they are out of sync.</p>

<p class="Normal-Single"> </p>
<p>You are able to easily update shared resources in the project by selecting 
 them and clicking Sync. Additionally, you are able to control the frequency 
 for comparing any linked resources and comparing what is shown in the 
 Resource Manager with the location it points to.</p>

<p>Resource Manager is specific to each installation of Adobe RoboHelp. 
 To see this in actual use you will need to configure the Resource Manager 
 to point to one or more folders where common content is located. Then 
 use an asset presented inside the Resource Manager pod by dragging from 
 the pod to the project.</p>
<h2>To add a location:</h2>
<ol class="BasicNumber"><li>Click 
 the Add Shared Location icon in the Resource Manager toolbar.</li><li>Navigate 
 to the location and click OK.</li><li>Type a 
 name to represent the location in the Resource Manager pod and click OK.</li></ol>


<h2>To insert a resource from the Resource Manager pod</h2>
<ol class="BasicNumber"><li style="counter-reset: item1 0;">Locate 
 the resource in the Resource Manager pod.</li><li>Click 
 and drag the resource from the pod to the topic where you want it to appear.</li></ol>

<h2>Share a Dropbox, or other cloud-based service, link with other authors</h2>
<p>Go to dropbox.com and authorize sharing with your co-authors.</p>
