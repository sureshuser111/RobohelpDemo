<h1>Printed Documentation Output</h1>
<p class="EmphasisSlate">Notwithstanding the trend to online information, 
 many users still require printed documentation. A major change introduced 
 in Adobe RoboHelp 11 was the ability to include your own headers and footers 
 in the printed outputs. You can define which sections have headers and 
 footers. Each section can be different and you can customize the formatting.</p>
<p>In <a href="../READ_FIRST.htm" id="a1">About Employee Care</a> it is 
 explained that whilst the online help is for the US audience, printed 
 documentation is required for the UK and Canadian users. This sample project 
 shows how the different content is created to allow those documents to 
 be produced, in addition to a printed document for the US users.</p>
<h2>General Settings</h2>
<p>By applying build tags to content, different text will be entered for 
 each of the three countries. When generating any output, the build expression 
 will define what <span>text is included and what is excluded.</span> See 
 the text options in this first image and see the build expression in the 
 second image.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/buildtags.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p>Since Adobe RoboHelp 11 you can generate multiple documents to the same 
 folder provided, of course, that they have different file names. Also 
 any links you have in your topics to popups will appear in your printed 
 documentation, provided the target topic is in the printed document.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/print_01_2015.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p class="Normal-Single">Note how much easier it is to select the build 
 expression. In older versions you would have seen the expression and had 
 to work out what would get included. The name makes it obvious. </p>

<h3>Headers and Footers</h3>
<p>Adding your own headers and footers can now be achieved using Master 
 Pages that you set up for the purpose. You can use existing Master Pages 
 but it is likely they will not quite meet your requirements.</p>
<ol class="RoundSquare"><li>You create 
 a Master Page that has the headers and footers that you want. The Master 
 Page Editor has some icons to add pre-configured options such as page 
 numbers and chapter names. You can click Insert &gt; Fields to add other 
 field level information such as the project title and / or date. You can 
 apply formatting to any part of the header and footer. See <a href="../Features/Master_Pages.htm">Master 
 Page Enhancements</a>.</li><li>In the 
 Header / Footer dropdown shown above, you can choose whichever Master 
 Page you want. By default that will be applied to every page in your printed 
 document.</li><li>You may 
 want to have different headers and footer in different sections or you 
 may want to only have headers and footers in the content section, with 
 nothing on the title page, the table of contents and suchlike. Click the 
 Multiple Header/Footer button to access the dialog below where you can 
 define your options.</li></ol>


<p class="ListSpacing">In this project the Master Pages for use with the 
 Printed Documentation Layouts have been set up with different options. 
 Note how the US Master Pages include different odd and even pages so that 
 the image is always on the outside when printing double sided.</p>
<p class="Normal-Single"> </p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/print_02.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p>Other Topics are topics added in the Section Layout as described below.</p>
<p>Word Documents refers to any Word documents that you add in the Section 
 Layout.</p>
<h3>Advanced Options</h3>
<p>The Advanced button allows you to set a few more options.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/print_03.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<h2>Content Settings</h2>
<p>When you first set up the content for your printed document, you will 
 see the Table of Contents you selected in both panes below and the books 
 will have the turquoise highlighting. In the Chapter Layout pane you can 
 change the order and you can delete topics if required. When you delete 
 topics, the turquoise highlighting will be removed to show that not all 
 its topics will be in the printed document.</p>
<p>Any changes you make later to the Table of Contents selected in the 
 General Settings will be made to the pane on the left. Note however that 
 the Chapter Layout will not reflect those changes. That is deliberate 
 as you may not want the printed document to include everything that is 
 in the Table of Contents.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/tip.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p>The quick way to keep the two panes in sync is to click the left facing 
 double chevron and then click the right facing double chevron.</p>
<p>The TOC dropdown also allows you to select topics not in the Table of 
 Contents. If you add them here, they will have the same headers and footers 
 as other topics in the Chapter Layout.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/print_04.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<h2>Section Layout Settings</h2>
<p>This page shows the default structure of your printed document. You 
 can rearrange the order and remove sections as well as adding other Word 
 documents into the layout.</p>
<p>You can also add topics to the section. You might want to do this to 
 add a topic right at the end of the document about how to contact your 
 organization, rather than it being part of the Chapter Layout.</p>
<p>The default title page can be deleted and you can substitute a cover 
 page that  you have created in Word or Adobe RoboHelp for the purpose. 
 That&#39;s especially useful if you have to apply a corporate design. See 
 the Printed Documentation US Century Gothic layout which uses a different 
 cover page and a different Word template.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/tip.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p>If you do design your own cover page in Word and you are going to apply 
 a Word template to the output (as described below in Appearance Settings), 
 it works best if both have been created from the same Word template. If 
 they are not from the same template, then do at least make sure the two 
 have the same settings for Word&#39;s Normal style. Otherwise you may get 
 some additional line spacing on the cover that needs to be removed.</p>
<p>In this sample project there are cover pages for both Letter Size paper 
 and A4 with different fonts and each of these can be mapped to a matched 
 Style Mapping template. Try creating different documents with different 
 cover pages and templates. The necessary files are in the root of the 
 project. They have also been copied to the Assets folder and you can import 
 them into your own project if they suit your needs.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/print_05.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<h2>Appearance Settings</h2>
<p>The final page before you generate your document defines the appearance 
 settings.</p>
<p>The options are to choose a Microsoft Word Template or a CSS Stylesheet. 
 Neither one is better than the other, it is dependent on various factors.</p>
<ol class="RoundSquare"><li style="counter-reset: item1 3;">You may 
 already have a corporate Word template that you are required to use.</li><li>You may 
 already want the same styles as in your project but with a green theme 
 rather than a blue theme. It might be easier to create that by tweaking 
 your CSS.</li></ol>

<p>In this example, the mapping is to a Microsoft Word template to show 
 how tables and multi-level list styles can be mapped using a Microsoft 
 Word template.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/print_06.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p>If you want to design your own cover pages, you need to set the paper 
 size, margins and so one to the same settings as the Adobe RoboHelp Style 
 Mapping templates. In the Assets folder, you will find two blank templates, 
 one set to Letter Size and US English and one set to A4 and UK English.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/tip.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p>You may want to break topics at various points in Word. Set up the customization 
 below with your preferred keyboard sequence. CTRL + Q is useful as you 
 can thumb CTRL and finger Q easily while you scroll through. Click anywhere 
 in the paragraph you want to start on the next page and use the command. 
 It also works nicely in the first paragraph in the first column of a table 
 to split it at that point.</p>
