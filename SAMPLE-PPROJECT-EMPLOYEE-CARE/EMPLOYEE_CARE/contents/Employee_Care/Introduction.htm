<p>These pages are designed to provide easy access to the <span data-keyref="CoName">Whirl the World</span> <span data-keyref="KB_Name">Employee Care 3</span> 
 knowledge base. The areas covered are shown below and also in the Table 
 of Contents alongside.</p>
<p data-condition="Others:AuthorContent"><img src="../assets/images/tip.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> This 
 table has been created using the No Border table. In the source file you 
 can see the table grid lines but in the output you will only see the content 
 not excluded by the build expression. It is a useful way of adding information 
 for your own use. Here the features used have been listed. Press CTRL 
 W and you will see this information and both columns below, select a Conditional 
 Build Tag Expression that includes Not Tip to see the topic as a user 
 would.</p>

<p data-condition="Others:AuthorContent"><img src="../assets/images/tip.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> All 
 pages have the section below. This information has been set up as a snippet 
 to allow it to be quickly changed across all topics. By using conditional 
 build tags, in the output it only shows the details for the geographic 
 location of the user. The email address has been defined as a variable 
 within the snippet. That would be useful if you needed the email address 
 to appear elsewhere in the topics. Here it is just shown as a concept.</p>
