<h1><span data-keyref="CoName">Whirl the World</span> - Harassment</h1>
<p>Harassment in any form, whether based on sex, color, religion, national or ethnic origin, age, marital status or handicap, will not be tolerated and can lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.</p>
<p>It is the company’s policy that sexual harassment of employees is strictly prohibited. Sexual harassment includes verbal, physical, and visual forms of harassment. No employment benefit shall be conditioned on the granting of sexual favours, and no employment decision shall be made on the basis of submission to or rejection of unwanted sexual advances. Any perceived violation of this policy should be reported directly to a Manager. If the results of an investigation confirm the offence, immediate disciplinary action, up to and including termination, will be taken against the employee violating this policy.</p>
