<p>Pension arrangements</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>You need to consider whether you want to receive your pension immediately or defer it until some future date. It is strongly recommended that you consult your own financial advisor before making this decision.</p>
<p>The company needs to know your decision no later than one month before your retirement date.</p>

<p>Leaving events</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Normally all employees will be taken to dinner by their line manager. A social occasion will also be funded by the company for all employees with over five years service.</p>
<p>It is recognized that some people prefer not to have such events. The company asks that two months notice is given of your wishes. In the event that you do not wish to have such an event, a donation can be made to a charity of the employees choice.</p>
</td>

<tr class="t2Row">
<td>
<p>Meetings with Line Manager</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Meet with your line manager three months and two months before you leave to discuss what information needs to be known by whoever will take over your responsibilities. Start preparing suitable documentation. At one month before you leave, the meetings should become weekly.</p>
<p>At this meeting you should also discuss any matters that are concerning you so that the company can address these matters.</p>
