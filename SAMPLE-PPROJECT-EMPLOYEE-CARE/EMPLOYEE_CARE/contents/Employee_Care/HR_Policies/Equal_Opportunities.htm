<h1><span data-keyref="CoName">Whirl the World</span> - Equal Opportunities</h1>
<p class="EmphasisSlate">The Company is an Equal Opportunities employer.  </p>
<p>The aim of this policy is to ensure that no job applicant or employee receives less favorable treatment on the grounds of gender, race, disability, color, nationality, ethnic or national origin, marital status, sexuality, responsibility for dependants, religion or belief, trade union activity and age.  </p>
<p>Selection criteria and procedures will be kept under review to ensure that individuals are selected, promoted and treated on the basis of their relevant merits and abilities. All employees will be given equality of opportunity within the company’s service and will be encouraged to progress within the organization. To ensure that direct or indirect discrimination is not occurring, recruitment and other employment decisions will be regularly monitored in conjunction with records of job applicants and existing employees. The company is committed to an ongoing programme of action to make this policy fully effective.</p>
<h2>Policy and Procedure</h2>
<p>Equal opportunity is about good employment practices and efficient use of our most valuable asset, our employees. Every manager and employee has personal responsibility for the implementation of the policy. Any instance of doubt about the application of the policy, or other questions, should be addressed to Human Resources, as should any requests for special training.</p>
<p>The company will not discriminate on grounds of sex, marital status, ethnic origin, color, nationality, disability or other grounds of discrimination not prohibited by legislation.</p>
<p>The policy applies to the advertisement of jobs, recruitment and appointment to them, training, conditions of work, pay and to every other aspect of employment.  The policy also applies equally to the treatment of our customers/clients. Staff involved in recruitment in particular should request training if they have any doubt about the application of this policy.</p>

<ol class="BasicNumber"><li>Recruiting only by word of mouth will not be practised by the company because this may restrict applications from groups who may be under-represented in the workforce.</li><li>When advertising the company will:<ol><li>Seek to use a wide range of organizations and / or publications to advertise its vacancies with the aim of attracting interest from a wider community.</li><li>Ensure that the wording of job adverts does not place unfair restrictions or requirements on a particular group or groups. Employees should also note that the imposition of a condition or requirement which has an adverse impact on someone, because his or her sex, race or marital status is more likely to be affected by it, will be unlawful unless it can be justified on grounds of business need. By way of example, a height requirement of 5’ 10” will eliminate some men but proportionately more women and so be unlawful. In all such situations Human Resources should be consulted.</li><li>Include in all advertisements a statement on Equal Opportunities and where necessary encourage applications from under-represented groups for jobs with the company.</li></ol></li></ol>
