<h1><span data-keyref="CoName">Whirl the World</span> - Company Cars</h1>
<p>Company cars are available to any UK employee who covers more than 10,000 miles on company business where it is anticipated this will continue year on year.</p>
<p>This is a taxable benefit even though the use is for business purposes. Where preferred, the employee can opt for a car allowance. It is a condition of accepting the car allowance that an appropriate vehicle is purchased to meet the business needs.</p>
<p>Details of the scheme are held by Human Resources and they will advise you of the monthly lease payment that will be sanctioned.</p>
