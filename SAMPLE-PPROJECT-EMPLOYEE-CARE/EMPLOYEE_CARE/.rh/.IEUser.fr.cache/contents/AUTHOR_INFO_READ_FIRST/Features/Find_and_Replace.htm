Find and Replace
Opening the Find and Replace Pod and Shortcuts
If you select some text and then press CTRL + F, the pod will open with 
 that text entered as the Find string. It can then be used as described 
 below.
The CTRL + Shift + F shortcut opens the pod with your previous search 
 string. It can then be used as described below.
Find - Basic Mode
Use Basic Mode for simple searches. You can search the Current Project, 
 the Current Window, Opened Topics  or a selected folder. Current 
 Window can be a topic or other pods
Changed in Adobe RoboHelp (2015 release) is that you can now limit 
 your search to just the topic content as seen by the end-user. If you 
 want to search in the code as well, tick Find in Source Code.
In Basic Mode you can use Regular Expressions.

Find - Advanced Mode
In Advanced Mode you can set parameters rather than a specific search.
Regular Expressions are disabled in this mode as the parameters are 
 using regular expressions so there would be a conflict.

Find and Replace - Basic Mode
The Replace Tab has the same options as the Find Tab plus an additional 
 field where you can specify a Replace string.

	Click Replace All to replace every instance without the option 
	 to leave or replace any specific instance. Do note the option to Backup 
	 Modified Files.
	Click Find Next to find the each instance of the Find. For each 
	 instance either click Find Next to continue searching without replacing 
	 or click Replace to update the string and locate the next instance.

As in the Find Tab, you can use Regular Expressions for the Find but 
 you cannot use them for the Replace.
